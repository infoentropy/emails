Copy:
So you tried meditation and it wasn’t so bad. Keep it up, you’re on your way to a calmer, clearer, and kinder you (without losing your edge).

Here are a couple of key takeaways from <i>The Big Idea</i>.

- Meditation is like sitting on a porch on a Sunday afternoon, you’re half-listening to the sounds of nature or maybe distant traffic, and absolutely nothing needs to be any different than it is. Basically you’re practicing being okay not doing anything and not trying to change anything.
- If thoughts are happening that’s ok, the trick with meditation is to just let them play out in the background, they’re like air balloons floating through the open sky of your mind.

Next:
In the next session we’ll explore how to find a homebase.

Copy:
Yes! You’ve completed another day of How to Meditate with Jeff Warren. Your mind is already stronger.

Here are a few things to remember from the session:

- Our minds wanders, that’s normal. Meditation is about creating a focus for the mind called a homebase. Your homebase can be the breath, sounds, or some point in the body.
- Getting distracted and coming back to your homebase is what meditation is all about. Think of it as a mental workout!
- You have the power to choose where you place your attention. This is important because what we pay attention to becomes our life.

Next:
In the next session we’ll keep exploring our homebase, and we’ll go a little deeper into how to work with our often rambunctious thinking process.

So you took a step back and started noticing your thoughts. Can you feel the power!?

Here’s a recap of your last meditation:
Don’t try and force your thoughts to stop. Thoughts are like Greyhound buses speeding through the desert. We can learn to get off the bus and sit on the side of the highway in one of those fold-out camping chairs, drinking a bevy as we watch the buses zoom by. From this place, we can also see the rest of the scenery, the beautiful wide open expanse of desert.

Next:
Meditation is an invitation to hop off the speeding bus, gain some perspective on our thoughts, and experience a wider, more peaceful place. In the next session we’ll explore one of the great secrets of meditation.

Equanimity is the word of the day. It means not pushing away or grabbing onto experience. Essentially, not tensing up to hold on to something or to resist it, but instead, relaxing into the moment, and finding some inner-smoothness. We’ll keep training this skill throughout the series because it takes practice to become a ninja!

Copy:
How to Meditate Day 6 Recap
The powerful thing about concentration is that it allows you to become one with what you’re doing. We call this being in “The Zone” and it feels really good. One of the best ways to strengthen the muscle of concentration is to pick a homebase that you actually like (the breath, a sensation or a point in the body). What worked best for you? The second thing that can help is labels. Basically, a word that we say to ourselves, to help us stay on track.

The longer you work with these techniques, the more you can come back to them any time and anywhere.

Realizing that we don’t need to believe all of our thoughts is a beautiful kind of freedom. That’s why it’s so helpful to notice when we’re lost inside our inner critic, or spiraling inside a visual memory of how we messed up, or simply overthinking.

How to Meditate Day 24 Recap
In our hyper-individualistic world where it seems everyone is competing for the biggest nut, it can be a challenge to feel gratitude and connection. Sadly this leaves us with feelings of envy, resentment, separation and anxiety. Taking time to remember all of the ways that we are interconnected with the world can make us feel like a part of a greater network. This is the network that includes all of life around us. Thanks, network!

A Recap of the Mental Muscles

- Concentration — we exercise this by returning to our homebase.
- Clarity — we work this by noticing.
- Equanimity — we train this by staying open and easy-going.
- Friendliness — we exercise this by being kind with ourselves especially when things feel difficult.

In the next session, we explore being over doing.

How to Meditate Day 26 Recap
For some of us, doing nothing is exactly the medicine we need. For others, it makes us feel spaced out or frustrated or even anxious. If that’s the case for you, not a problem. That’s why we have the option of a homebase: a place we can go that anchors us, that gives us a very small thing to do, as a stepping stone towards trusting that, in the final game, we don’t need to do anything to prove we’re allowed to exist. What was your experience?

In the next session, we continue to explore the art of no agenda.

How to Meditate Day 27 Recap
One way to meditate is to rest in a place with nothing to do and nowhere to go. Many of us have no idea how much energy we expend trying to control our experience. If it’s helpful, you can imagine yourself some place where it would be easy for you to settle in. Interestingly, it’s often when we let go of our agenda, that our best creative ideas come to us. Essentially, this approach to meditation-- and to life-- is how we learn to get out of our own way.

In the next session, we explore the beautiful freedom of not knowing.

How to Meditate Day 28 Recap
It’s important to rest our weary minds from always looking for an answer. A practice to help let go of our neediness for knowledge is to say, “Don’t know. Don’t need to know.”, every time the mind asks a question. This opens us up to a a different kind of knowing. Things we know in our heart. Things too big for the mind to comprehend.

Awareness is who you really are. Rest in that awareness. This is another homebase to explore. If that works for you, awesome. If not, no sweat. Practice the technique you like, the one that’s been working for you. Every homebase will lead you home.

How to Meditate Day 30 Recap
Consistency – practicing everyday, or every other day – matters more than length. When you meditate every day, your mind and body can really lock into the habit. That’s why you sit even when you don’t feel like it, even when you think it’s going badly. It’s not going badly - it’s going normally. You’re building the habit of being okay with whatever’s going on.  It’s saying who I am is always enough. It’s love. From this, we come into our power, and we inspire others to come into theirs.

What’s next?
Now it’s time to explore the Calm app. There are lots of different meditation programs and themes to choose from depending on what you want to explore. We recommend the Daily Calm, a fresh new meditation to explore each day.  It’s an amazing way to build consistency in your practice. You’ve completed 30 days, why not try for 365!
